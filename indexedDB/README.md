# Indexed DB

## Use

Drag and drop on browser index.html. Look console.

## Purpose

Put blob data in IndexedDB, then get that blob data and console.log.

## Why ?

To store binary data from websocket. (To limit download request by refreshing.)

## Commentary

This is a very basic use and a first approche. The IndexedDB API can do a lot, like make multiple 'table' in a db, create cursor to go through all the "table" and more. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API.
